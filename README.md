#Social Cube :

This was a project done in 30hrs during [HackMIT](www.HackMIT.org)2013.
The challenge was to create everything using native HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
I managed to create the cube and everything in 3D using only the above
languages and I used Google, SoundCloud, Wunderground and Youtube APIs
to make the cube interactive.

>Note : Since it was during a hackathon, I didn't have time to adapt it to
>every browser so it only works in Firefox for now. Moreover, I only implemented
>4 faces because I didn't have time to do the 2 others but I will add modifications
>soon.
